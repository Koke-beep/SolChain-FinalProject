        <h4>Genesis Ready Validator</h4>
        <p>ILong term partnerships are our type of cooperation. We have already joined multiple projects as a genesis validator and
          thus have experience and capabilities when it comes to the initial stages of a network, from permissionless to permission
          based networks that use protocols like Corda R3. Our support can start with the very first block generated and signed on a testnet to mainnet genesis and beyond.
